Kaggle Project 1 - Forest Parameters Analysis: 
Analyzed forest parameters including height, diameter, basal area, volume, biomass, and species data. 
Use of allometric equations from Gerard Imani (2017) and Chave et al. for estimating height and biomass, respectively. 

Kaggle Project 2 - Carbon Emissions Time Series Analysis
GitHub Repository
I analyzed carbon emissions data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, correlations, and anomalies. 
Using Python libraries like Pandas, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn, I performed time series analysis, ARIMA forecasting, KMeans clustering, and Isolation Forest anomaly detection. 
The project yielded significant insights and reliable forecasts.
